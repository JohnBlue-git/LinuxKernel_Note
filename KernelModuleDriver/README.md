# Linux Kernel vs. Linux Modules
* ***Linux Kernel:*** The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It provides essential services such as process management, memory management, device drivers, filesystem support, and networking capabilities. ***The kernel is loaded into memory during the boot process and remains resident*** in memory throughout the system's uptime. The Linux kernel is typically compiled as a monolithic kernel, where all core functionalities are compiled together into a single binary (vmlinux or vmlinuz).
* ***Linux Modules:*** Linux modules, also known as loadable kernel modules (LKMs), are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded from the running kernel dynamically. They extend the kernelâ€™s functionality ***without requiring a reboot***. Modules are compiled separately from the main kernel and are usually stored as .ko files.

# Modules Key Characteristics
* ***Dynamic Loading / Unloading***
* ***Functionality Extension*** (provide additional functionality / support hardware and software configurations without bloating the core kernel / support)
* ***Dependency Management*** (When a module is loaded, the kernel ensures that its dependencies are also loaded, resolving dependencies automatically using tools like modprobe)

# Modules Examples
* ***Device Drivers:*** USB controllers, network adapters, graphics cards, etc.
* ***Filesystem Modules:*** ext4, NTFS, FAT, etc.
* ***Networking Modules:*** TCP/IP stack, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.

# Module Management Commands
* ***insmod:*** Inserts a module into the kernel.
* ***rmmod:*** Removes a module from the kernel.
* ***modprobe:*** A more advanced utility that manages module loading and unloading, including handling dependencies and configuration.

# Driver and Plug-and-Play (PnP)
Normal procedure of plugin should look like:
* First, Devices would establish communication with OS without requiring custom drivers for basic functionality.
* Second, Devices provide necessary configuration information (through descriptors in USB devices / USB Vendor ID and Product ID / ...) that allows the OS to understand its capabilities and how to interact with it.
* Third, kernel will assigns resources (such as IRQs or memory addresses), and loads appropriate drivers.

The driver design should consider:
* Dynamic Loading and Unloading
* Notification Mechanisms (register with OS notification; ex: connected, disconnected, etc)
* Resource Management (ex: memory buffers, DMA channels, etc.)
* Support Power Management
* Compatibility and Error Handling

Notes:
* Loading/ Unloading: Via usb_driver_init() & usb_driver_exit()
* Resource Management: Linux kernel APIs (devm_kzalloc(), devm_kfree(), etc.) are used for memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring proper resource management.
* Debugging and Logging: pr_info() and dev_info() are used for logging messages, which can be viewed using kernel log utilities (dmesg, journalctl).
* Interrupt Endpoint Handling: Ensure you correctly handle the interrupt endpoint of your USB device. The example uses interface->cur_altsetting->endpoint[0].desc.bInterval as a simplified approach; in a real scenario, you would determine the correct endpoint for interrupts based on your device's descriptor.
